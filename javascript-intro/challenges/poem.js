console.log(
  "Do not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rage at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light"
);
console.log(
  "\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night."
);
console.log(
  "\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
console.log(
  "\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night."
);
console.log(
  "\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
console.log(
  "\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
